# Tourism-Management-System
Now-a-dayâ€™s number of people, using internet is increasing exponentially, so the use of web applications is also increasing.  This is a proposal to design a web application for booking a package for Tourists.
Tourism Management System is a web application which gives information on packages available to the users, the user has to register/login the web application and select the package and book the package for a particular date. The user can change the package or cancel the package at any time. User can also change the date of the package. The user can select the food they want to eat from the menu and they can modify the items or can delete the items. 
This web application will help the user to save time and money. Many of them spend their time by visiting the office and gather information, discuss with the people and pay the money. By this application user can directly see the packages from his place without visiting any office and wasting their time.
